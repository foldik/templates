# Teamplates

This project contains different templates for different projects.

__A few words about the philosophy of this project before you would go further__

- Prefer small artifacts,
- prefer low memory consumption,
- prefer fast build time,
- prefer languages with advanced type systems (Rust, Elm <3),
- this project is not for those who use the term "premature optimization" too often ([very good article about it](http://joeduffyblog.com/2010/09/06/the-premature-optimization-is-evil-myth/)),
- reduce dependencies as much as possible (this is not the project where you will see a Spring Boot application with thousands of dependencies and wondering why does it take so much time to build/test/deploy).
